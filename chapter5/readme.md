Chapter 5: Lab Example 2

In this lab example, you will follow a YouTube tutorial by Mike X Cohen [1]. Mike X Cohen has many tutorials on his YouTube platform, where he guides viewers through many examples of imaging data analysis using engineering tools. For this lab, we will be using MATLAB as our tool. You should already have MATLAB downloaded; if you do not, instructions on downloading MATLAB can be found in Chapter 1, Lab Example 1. 
To get started, here is a link to Mike X Cohen’s YouTube page:

Once you are on his page, you want to navigate to the Playlists tab and then find the Essentials of Neuroscience with MATLAB playlist. When the playlist is open, you will notice on the right-hand side that there are several modules in this playlist. For this lab example, we will follow Module 4 (FMRI). In this module, Mike X Cohen provides an example of processing fMRI data from an experiment using visual stimuli. As mentioned in Chapter 8, the brain's visual cortex is retinotopically organized, and in this lab, we will be able to see that organization. Mike X Cohen uses a data set from Kay et al., 2020 [2]. In this study, the researchers are testing a new method called Temporal Decomposition to improve the spatial resolution of fMRI data analyzed with tasked tasks. 
In Module 4-1, Mike X Cohen explains the task in this study. In the study, participants looked at visual stimuli, where they needed to look at the dot in the center of a ring. The ring’s eccentricity changed in size throughout six conditions, where in condition one, the ring was closest to the dot, and in condition six, it was furthest away from the dot.

This task presents visual stimuli from different distances from the fovea. Due to the retinotopic organization of the visual cortex, the visual stimuli produced by condition one, where the ring is closest to the center dot, activate central vision in the fovea. Higher visual cortex activation will occur at the calcarine fissure (refer to Chapter 8 Figure 8.6). As the visual gets further from the center, the stimuli will progressively move away from the calcarine fissure. You will see this progression of activation in the images generated by the lab. 

After you have found Mike X Cohen’s page and this module, go to the caption of the Module 4-1 video. In the caption, Mike X Cohen has provided all the code and data files needed for this lab. Once you click on the link, a file will download. In this folder, you will see several MATLAB files. You will first want to open the exampledataset.mat file, and an Import Wizard box will pop up.

You will want to click finished and have the data imported into your workspace in MATLAB. 
Once you have finished this, you will want to navigate to matlab4neuros_module4_partial.mat file. This file contains code Mike X Cohen will walk you through in each video, where you can code with him to produce the figures. It is recommended that you use this code in a live script. When the code is uploaded into MATLAB, you will be prompted to “Open this file as a live script.” You will want to click “Open as a live script.”

You will then watch Mike X Cohen’s videos for Module 4 (FMRI). This lab has several parts, during which you will create flat maps of the fMRI data, different visualizations for the BOLD response, and conduct a t-test. 
In Video 2, you can create and visualize the flat maps. A flat map is a two-dimensional representation of the brain’s cortical surface. Flat maps are made by reconstructing the cortical surface and then inflating it to smooth the gyri and sulci. Then, the surface is flattened into a 2D map, preserving the spatial relationships of the cortical regions. Here is a video from YouTube from MNE-Python that shows how flat maps are created.

By the end of Module 4, Video 2 of Mike X Cohen’s tutorial, you will see the flat maps.

After you have completed Video 2, you will move on to Video 3, where you will preprocess the BOLD signal data. You will produce a figure showing the BOLD time course from a specific voxel in this video. In the figure, the x-axis represents the time in seconds (s), and the y-axis represents the intensity of the BOLD signal in arbitrary units (a.u.). This figure depicts changes in the blood oxygenation of this voxel over time.

Once you finish with Video 3, you will move onto Video 4, where you will explore the design matrix the researchers used in their experimentation. In this video, you will produce three different visualizations. 
The first figure you create depicts when they presented each stimulus category over time.

Can you say that it is quite hard to understand the design matrix when it is in this form? Mike X Cohen explains this in this video and shows you how to convert this into a gray figure using the following code. 

% perhaps it's easier to visualize as an image?
imagesc(design{1})
xlabel('Condition number')
ylabel('Time (TR)')
colormap gray

Your figure will now look like this.

Now, it is much easier to see which condition (x-axis) has been presented over time (y-axis). The next step you will take in this video is to plot the events over the time course of the BOLD response. You will produce a figure that looks like this.

Next, you will produce Figure 7, which visualizes the even-related data matrix. It will look like this.

This figure shows the differences in BOLD activity over time (x-axis) for the different voxel indices (y-axis). This matrix allows for visualizing how the BOLD signal varies across the different voxels during a task over time. 

Next, you will watch Module 4, Video 5 of Mike X Cohen's tutorial, where you will create an animation of the bold response over time. You will first make a 2D Gaussian distribution heal mat map. In a Gaussian distribution, values are highest in the center and taper off symmetrically toward the edges.

Next you will produce the animation where you will see the progression of the BOLD response over time for each condition of the visual task from the study. Here is how the animation will look.

Next, you will watch Module 4, Video 6 of the tutorial, where Mike X Cohen will set you up for the statistical analysis of the data, and you will create a new data visualization. Following this tutorial, we encountered an error message stating, “Dot indexing is not supported for variables of this type.” This error was fixed by coding in 

datacursormode on
Under % step 1: turn datacursormode on and click on a map instead of put it in the command window.

Your figure will look like this. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1a15903-2e61-42ae-9cf8-b125d41580f4)

 
Here, you see the BOLD response (y-axis) over time (x-axis) for the different conditions for the selected voxel. 

In the final video, Module 4, Video 7 of the Mike X Cohen tutorial series, you will conduct a t-test and visualize it on a map. A t-test is a statistical test that compares the means of two groups to determine if they are significantly different from each other. In this case, you will be comparing the differences of BOLD activity for condition one, where the ring is closest to the center dot, and condition six, where the ring is the furthest from the center dot. The figure you will generate looks like this. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58e49645-f631-43cc-bd10-a2dc655d55a7)

 
In this figure, you will see two different colors, red and blue. Red represents areas where condition one has a significantly higher BOLD response than condition six. This makes sense since the red coloring is located at the calcarine fissure. Blue represents areas where condition six has significantly higher BOLD responses than condition one. This makes sense since blue is farther away from the calcarine fissure, indicating visual stimuli in peripheral vision. It is worth noting that Mike X Cohen explains why a t-test is not the best way to analyze this data. This is because there are a lot of variances in the BOLD response that will be ignored when conducting a t-test at a certain time. However, learning how to conduct t-tests in MATLAB is good since they are fundamental statistical tests.
That will conclude the fMRI tutorial from Mike X Cohen on YouTube. Mike X Cohen provides several other examples of understanding data from imaging techniques in other tutorials on his YouTube page, which was linked at the beginning of this lab. 
YouTube is a tool that you can use to find a lot of tutorials using engineering tools to get started learning the platforms.
