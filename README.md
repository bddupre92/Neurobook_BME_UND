# Neurobook_BME_UND
This repository houses all code bases, examples, and Read Me's for the Open Source Neuroengineering Book developed by students at the University of North Dakota BME Program

# Neuron Simulation Project

This repository contains code examples for each chapter in the Neuoengineering textbook. Each chapter of the book has its own folder containing relevant code examples, a `README.md` for instructions, and a `requirements.txt` for dependencies if applicable.
Code examples are written in various languages, styles, and requirements to allow for a breadth of experiences. As you go through the code examples, utilize your knowledge from the chapter to reinforce your learning!

We hope you enjoy your journey through this github!
