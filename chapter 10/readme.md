## Chapter 10 lab 2
In this lab, we will explore Psychtoolbox and apply our knowledge through a practical task. Specifically, we will implement a working memory task inspired by the visual working memory capacity experiment conducted by Vogel and Machizawa (2004). You can access the original research article at https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02447.- 
Psychtoolbox is a collection of free software tools that facilitates the design and implementation of precise and complex visual and auditory stimuli for psychological experiments. It is widely used in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and vision research. Here are some key features and components of Psychtoolbox:
- 1.	Platform Compatibility: Psychtoolbox is primarily used with MATLAB and GNU Octave, making it accessible to users who prefer different programming environments.
- 2.	Stimulus Presentation: It allows for the creation and control of visual and auditory stimuli with high temporal and spatial precision. This is crucial for experiments requiring exact timing and synchronization.
- 3.	Graphics and Sound: Psychtoolbox includes functions for generating and manipulating graphics, images, and sounds. This allows researchers to create complex visual displays and auditory sequences.
- 4.	Hardware Interaction: It supports interaction with various hardware devices such as eye trackers, response boxes, and other input/output devices, enabling comprehensive experimental setups.
- 5.	Open Source: Being an open-source toolkit, Psychtoolbox is freely available and can be modified to suit specific research needs.
- 6.	Community Support: There is a strong community of users and developers who contribute to the toolbox, provide support, and share scripts and solutions.
Psychtoolbox is particularly powerful in experiments that require precise control over stimulus timing and presentation, such as studies in visual perception, auditory processing, and reaction time measurement.
It is available for both MATLAB and Octave. This powerful tool offers a range of commands that simplify the process of creating experiments. For more information about the available functions, visit: Psychtoolbox Documentation. After installing Psychtoolbox in MATLAB, you can begin designing your own experiments. In this instance, we will use an implementation provided by Marvin Theiss.
