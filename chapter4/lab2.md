In this lab, we will become familiar with EEGLAB, a MATLAB toolbox designed for processing electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and other electrophysiological data. Distributed under the free BSD license, EEGLAB offers a comprehensive suite of tools for displaying and analyzing EEG data.
## Installation and Main Features
EEGLAB is hosted by the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience at UC San Diego. You can download the toolbox from this link. We extend our gratitude to UC San Diego for providing this valuable resource.
Download and Installation
The download and installation process is similar to that of other MATLAB toolboxes:
1.	Visit the EEGLAB download page.
2.	Follow the instructions provided to download the appropriate version for your system.
3.	Unzip the downloaded file to a convenient directory on your computer.
4.	Add the EEGLAB folder to your MATLAB path.
##Running EEGLAB
After installation, you can launch EEGLAB by running the eeglab.m file. To do this:
1.	Open MATLAB.
2.	Navigate to the directory where you unzipped EEGLAB.
3.	Type eeglab in the MATLAB command window and press Enter.
This action should open the EEGLAB graphical user interface (GUI), which will appear as follows:
